1) Supported SystemC versions
=============================
SystemC 2.1.v1 and 2.2.0 are supported and have been tested.

2) What's changed in this kit?
==============================

Compared to the 29 Nov 2007 draft 2 kit, the standard has evolved in the 
following primary ways:
  - the file and directory structure has undergone further cleaning
  - resolved confusion on multiple interfaces, and loosely timed versus untimed 
    modeling by:
  	- LT = single phase hence blocking API with support for timing 
	       annotation (&temporal decoupling)
	- AT = multi-phase hence non-blocking API with extensible number of 
	       phases
  - unified the interfaces: that means both API's need to be implemented by 
    all compliant models
  - added convenience sockets (implementing LT-AT conversion and multiple 
    bindings)
  - better support for extended protocol definitions by reusing GP for DMI and 
    debug
  - support for ignorable phase extentions
  - added exmaple for instance based extentions
  - provided with endianness (conversion) helper functions
  - now using char * for byte-enable array 
  - Documentation (training presentation and users manual)
  	- updated for the changes above
	- additional semantical clarifications
	- well-defined transaction ordering rules
  - Examples have been updated for the changes in the standard
For a more detailed description of all features of TLM 2.0 check out the TLM 2.0
manual that can be found in the documentation subdirectory of this package

3) Known issues
===============

a. when using TLM 2.0 with SystemC v2.2.v1 on 64 bit linux you will need to 
   force 32 bit mode by using the '-m32' flag

b. the tlm_simple_target_socket in tlm_utils does not obey the END_REQ rule
   when only an nb_ call is registered, an b_ call is being handled in the
   socket and there is an nb_ call coming in at the same time. In this case
   the incoming nb_ call will be forwarded to the registered nb_ call without
   checking whether the earlier b_ call has passed the END_REQ timing point
 
c. the implementation of the PEQ 'peq_with_get' in tlm_utils does not properly
   distinguish between immediate notifications and delta notifications. In the
   case that a immediate and delta notification happen at the same simulation
   time both types of notifications emerge from the PEQ in the same evaluation 
   phase. This is wrong immediate notifications should overtake delta 
   notifications
   
d. the multi_passthrough_initiator_socket and multi_passthrough_target_socket do
   depends on a boost library and does not work with SystemC2.1.v1 due to boost
   incompatibilities

e. the examples do not successfully 'make check' on bigendian machines, messages
   are not printed correctly in that case.
   
f. the lt_dmi example does not run for all platform and library versions. It
   works for X86 linux, gcc4.0 and SystemCv2.2.0

1) Supported SystemC versions
=============================
SystemC 2.1.v1 and 2.2.0 are supported and have been tested.

2) What's changed in this kit?
==============================

Compared to the 29 Nov 2006 draft 1 kit, draft 2 has evolved in the following
primary ways:
  - Many of the features have undergone significant change:
    - Untimed modeling
    - Approximately timed modeling
    - The generic payload and its extension mechanism
    - Non-intrusive (debug) transactions
  - Several new features have been incorporated:
    - Loosely timed modeling
    - Temporal decoupling
    - Model synchronization
    - Direct memory interface (DMI)
  - Documentation (training presentation and users manual) is provided
  - Examples have been improved

3) Areas under construction
===========================

This is a draft kit for public review so any of it is subject to change.  
During the public review, there will be ongoing work to improve the 
documentation and provide more examples.  Some of the planned investigations
are:
  - consider generic payload support for atomic transactions
  - improve the analysis ports and integrate them with sockets
  - extend DMI to support snooping and consider a direct channel for bus
    bypass to non-memory models
  - enforce payload modifiability rules
  - some features of the generic payload need to be programmed differently 
    depending on host endianness; helper functions will be provided to isolate
    the modeler from these details; key issues are demonstrated in the 
    gp_extension/GenericPayloadEndianness unit test, which produces
    host-endian dependent results and therefore is not part of the automated
    regression suite
Additional detail on some of these topics can be found in the users manual.
