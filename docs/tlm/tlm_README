README  for  TLM-2.0.1  2009-July-15
====================================

This is the proof of concept implementation for the OSCI TLM-2.0 standard.

This release includes the OSCI TLM-2.0 Language Reference Manual

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                IMPORTANT

1. This version of the TLM-2.0 standard is a further evolution of draft 2 which
   in itself represents a significant evolution since the draft 1 kit.  
   This version is not, nor was it intended to be, backwards compatible with 
   draft 2 and draft 1.
   
2. The version number 2.0.1 signifies the version of the software release, not 
   the version of the OSCI TLM-2.0 standard. This version of the
   TLM-2.0 proof of concept implementation is intended to be fully compliant 
   with the OSCI TLM-2.0 Language Reference Manual.

3. This release has been tested on the following platforms:

   32-bit platforms
     Linux Redhat 3              with gcc 3.2.3  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux Redhat Enterprise 4   with gcc-3.3.2  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux Redhat Enterprise 4   with gcc-3.4.3  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux Redhat Enterprise 4   with gcc-3.4.4  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux Redhat Enterprise 5   with gcc-4.1.2  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux Fedora 11             with gcc-4.4.0  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux Fedora 11             with gcc-4.4.0  and 2.3.16jun09_beta

     Windows XP Cygwin (Cygming) with gcc-3.4.   and SystemC-2.1.v1

     Windows XP SP2/SP3          with MS Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition 
                                                 and SystemC-2.2.0
                                                 
     SPARC Solaris 5.8           with gcc 3.3.2  and SystemC-2.2.0
     SPARC Solaris 5.8           with gcc 3.4.2  and SystemC-2.2.0
     
   64-bit platforms
     Linux RedHat Enterprise 4   with gcc-3.4.3  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux RedHat Enterprise 4   with gcc-4.0.3  and SystemC-2.2.0
     Linux SUSE Enterprise 9     with gcc-4.2.2  and SystemC-2.2.0
     

   But to have SystemC itself work with gcc-4.2.2 or gcc-4.4.0 requires the following 
   change:
   Edit the file systemc-2.2.0/include/sysc/packages/boost/bind/placeholders.hpp
   change line 28
   from
     #if defined(__BORLANDC__)
   to
     #if defined(__BORLANDC__) || defined(__GNUC__)

Installation

   No installation, as such, required; simply extract contents of the
   downloaded package.

Release Notes

   See the separate RELEASENOTES file that provides up-to date
   information about this release of TLM 2.0.

User Documentation

   You can find documentation for this release in the docs directory. There is 
   doxygen generated documentation in the doxygen/ subdirectory of docs/ the 
   user manual and training presentation can be found in the release/ 
   subdirectory of docs/. It is recommended that you start with the training 
   presentation (TLM_2_0_presentation.pps) and then the Language Reference Manual 
   (TLM-2.0 LRM.pdf).
   See docs/release/README.txt for a description and status of the other 
   documentation.

Directory Structure

   The TLM kit's directory structure has been patterned after that used 
   for the SystemC language and Verification library (SCV).
   Dirs: include/   : contains the TLM 2.0 standard headers
         unit_test/ : contains a set of tests for TLM 2.0
	 examples/  : contains the examples that come with the TLM 2.0 kit
	 docs/	    : contains the documentation for TLM 2.0

Build Support
 
   To use TLM2.0 all you need is the SystemC headers. TLM2.0 has been tested
   with SystemC versions 2.2.0 and 2.1.v1. 
   
   In earlier versions of TLM-2.0, the multi_passthrough sockets in the tlm_utils 
   directory depended on the boost library. This is not true of the current release.
   
   Support for building the examples and unit tests is provided for 'unix', and
   'msvc' (project and make files).

   Makefiles work hierarchically.  Build is the default target; 'clean', 
   'run' (executes built tests/examples) and 'check' (against expected 
   results) targets are also provided.  
   On Unix/Linux/MacOS, the $TLM_HOME environment variable should be set to this
   kit's location; $SYSTEMC_HOME and $TARGET_ARCH should be defined such that
   $SYSTEMC_HOME/lib-$TARGET_ARCH is a directory containing the systemc library.
   On Windows, the SYSTEMC and TLM environments variables should be used.

   Please check the README.txt file for the unit_tests how to setup the build
   environment for different compiler and library versions.

Examples

   There is a set of examples available under the examples/ directory, they
   illustrate the key features of the TLM 2.0 standard. For more information see
   the README.txt. 

Unit Tests

   The unit tests, though not as complete or documented as the examples, can 
   be illustrative for other features of the kit such as payload extensions, 
   UT & AT modeling, transactors, temporal decoupling, direct memory interface,
   etc.
   See instructions in unit_test/README.txt

Problems

   Any problems related to the use of this kit can be submitted to
