This is the release of the SystemC 3.0.0 Class Library.
This release implements the IEEE 1666-2023 Language Reference Manual.

---

1. This release is supported on the following platform combinations 
   for which it has been tested:

   * 64-bit Linux (x86_64), RedHat Enterprise 7 & 8
      - GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-9.3.0 through gcc-11.1.0
      - Clang C++ compiler versions clang-11.1 through clang-13.0.0

   * 64-bit Linux (aarch64), Ubuntu 18 & 20
      - GNU C++ compiler version gcc-9.3

   * 64-bit macOS (macosarm64, macosx64, macosuniversal, macosunknown), macOS 11.6 (Big Sur) until 14.1 (Sonoma)
      - Xcode/AppleClang compiler version 12.0 until version 15.0

   * Microsoft Windows 10
      - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (15.0) (Win32 and x64)

   Warning: _The fixed-point datatypes are not working as defined on
   MSVC 2017 and later in Release x64 mode._

   This release has not been tested or is known not to work as expected
   on the following formerly supported platforms:

   * GNU C++ compiler versions prior to 9.3.0 (all platforms)
   * FreeBSD 9.0 or later (x86, x86_64) with GNU C++ compiler
   * HP-UX 11.00 or later with GNU C++ or HP C++ compiler
   * Sun/Oracle Solaris, with GNU C++ or Sun/Solaris Studio compiler
   * macOS prior to 11.6 (Big Sur) and/or on the x86, PowerPC architectures
   * Microsoft Visual C++ versions prior to 2017 (15.0)
   * Cygwin 1.7 or later (x86, x86_64) with GNU C++ compiler
   * Msys/MinGW32 GNU C++ compiler

2. (In)compatibility note

   While it is possible to build SystemC as a shared library (both on
   ELF-based systems and well as a DLL on Windows), there is no explicitly
   defined binary interface across different

    - SystemC implementations (e.g. from multiple vendors)
    - SystemC library versions
    - Compilers or compiler versions
    - Operating systems or OS versions

   Some differences might be caught at link time, while other incompatibilities
   could just silently lead to undefined behavior during simulation.  Please
   carefully ensure a consistent build configuration, when integrating binary
   SystemC models built from separate sources.

## 2. What's new in this release?

This version of SystemC contains the "Proof of Concept" simulator
for the IEEE 1666-2023 SystemC standard. Please consult the IEEE Std
1666-2023 SystemC Language Reference Manual for details about the
current SystemC standard.


Compared to the 2.3.4 release, this release has the following new items:

  - New features and API changes implemented to reflect the IEEE 1666-2023 revision, see section 3.
  
  - Bug fixes and enhancements, see section 4.

  - Deprecated features, see section 5.

  - Experimental features (some disabled by default), see section 7.
    Testing and feedback welcome via the Accellera SystemC forums
    at http://forums.accellera.org/forum/9-systemc/.
    
  - Updated platform support, see the [README.md](README.md).


## 3. New features

Here is an overview of the new features available in 3.0.0.

  - New class `sc_core::sc_stage_callback_if` provides an interface to enable user-defined callbacks during elaboration or simulation stages that are otherwise not available to the application.

  - New functions to suspend and unsuspend the simulation kernel.

  - The constructor macro `SC_CTOR` now supports additional constructor parameters.

  - Class `sc_core::sc_event` introduces the member function triggered to determine whether an event has recently been triggered.

  - The enumeration type `sc_core::sc_time_unit` now supports attosecond (`sc_core::SC_AS`), zeptosecond (`sc_core::SC_ZS`), and yoctosecond (`sc_core::SC_YS`).

  - Class `sc_core::sc_time` supports a constructor passing the time as string argument.

  - New class `sc_core::sc_hierarchy_scope` provides an interface to allow an application to place objects of type `sc_core::sc_object` in an object hierarchy outside the current hierarchical scope.

  - New functions are defined to register and un-register hierarchical names.

  - New static object `sc_core::sc_unbound` can be used in an application to make an unbound (open) connection to a port. In addition, the function `sc_core::sc_tie::value(const &T)` can be used to tie a port to a specified value of type T.

  - New definition supports tracing of types `sc_core::sc_event` and `sc_core::sc_time` using `sc_core::sc_trace`.

  - New functions `sc_core::sc_vector::emplace_back` and `sc_core::sc_vector::emplace_back_with_name` support making incremental additions to `sc_core::sc_vector`.


## 4. Bug fixes and enhancements

For bug fixes added in 2.3.4 (or before) already, please refer to the previous
RELEASENOTES.

Following is the list of bug fixes and enhancements for the 3.0.0 release:

  - Execution speed improvements for the SystemC datatypes

  - Fixed MSVC warnings in examples

  - Fixed automake flow for datatypes


## 5. Deprecated features

Here is an overview of deprecated features:

  - Macro `SC_HAS_PROCESS` is not required anymore and has been deprecated

  - constructor: `sc_time(double, bool)` has been deprecated

  - constructor: `sc_time(uint64, bool)` has been deprecated

  - function: `sc_set_default_time_unit` has been deprecated

  - function: `sc_get_default_time_unit` has been deprecated 


## 6. C++17 support

IEEE 1666-2023 mandates C++17 as the baseline for SystemC implementations. 
string_view is used in new APIs. However, `const char *` are still used 
in several locations and will be progressively cleaned-up in the upcoming releases.


## 7. Experimental features

Some of these features are not enabled in the default library
configuration and need to be explicitly activated during at
library build time.  See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.


## 8. Known Problems

  - This implementation currently truncates "small" `sc_time` objects to  SC_ZERO_TIME,
    while "too big‚Äù objects wrap-around `sc_max_time()` and lead to a value modulo the
    maximum time.  In both cases, no warning is generated, even though such a warning
    is mandated by IEEE 1666-2023

  - Some typos have not been fixed in the version of the IEEE 1666-2023 document available 
    online, but have been implemented in this release:
      - the following stage callbacks are implemented
        ``` 
        void sc_register_stage_callback( sc_stage_callback_if&, int );
        void sc_unregister_stage_callback( sc_stage_callback_if&, int );
        ```
      - `static const sc_event & none()` is implemented
      - `IEEE_1666_SYSTEMC` is set to `202301L`


  - The SystemC non regression test suite still available does not take into account 
    all the alignments done in the reference implementation to align to IEEE 1666-2023. 
    Therefore, the non regression tests might not compile or not behave as expected, 
    this will be fixed in an upcoming delivery.


  - The sign-extension of mixed-signedness logic expressions (&,|)
    involving one `sc_bigint<>` operand and C++ builtin integral types
    (int, short, etc.) is inconsistent between 32-bit and 64-bit
    platforms in some cases. Convert both operands to `sc_bigint<>` first.


  - The definition of `sc_dt::(u)int64` differs from `std::(u)int64_t` types
    on some platforms.  This may lead to problems with function overloads
    and/or format-string placeholders.  As a workaround, convert these
    values explicitly to the correct type before passing them to functions
    expecting one of these types.  For `sc_time`, use the new nested type
    `sc_time::value_type` to hold values of the underlying representation.


  - Bit/logic-vector reductions (or_reduce, and_reduce, etc.) return an
    `sc_logic_value_t` enum value, instead of a `bool` or `sc_logic` (as required
    by IEEE 1666-2011).  Using the return value of these functions in a
    boolean context, e.g.
    ```
      if ( lv.or_reduce() ) { /* ... */ }
    ```
    might lead to wrong results in case of `'X'` or `'Z'` bits in the vector.
    Avoid this by converting the result to an `sc_logic` first and perform
    a safe conversion to bool:
    ```
      if ( sc_logic( lv.or_reduce() ).to_bool() ) { /* ... */ }
    ```

  - The current implementation of bit-wise operations on `sc_bv` and other
    bit types implicitly uses the left-hand argument as the size of the result
    rather than the size of the larger operand, as required by the IEEE 1666
    standard.


  - The fixed-point implementation is not working correctly on MSVC 2017
    or later, when built with optimization enabled (Release mode, 64-bit).  On this compiler/platform, optimization needs to be disabled when using the
    fixed-point library (for all SystemC versions before and including 2.3.2).


  - Some paths in this release are longer than the historical 99 character
    limit of tar archives, and several Windows archivers (e.g. WinZip)
    have been reported to trip over this.  The open source archiver 7-zip
    (http://7-zip.org) is known to work.


## 9. Fixed-point library

SystemC contains a fixed-point datatypes package.

Compile-time macro `SC_INCLUDE_FX` must be defined in order to build
applications that use fixed point types. You can specify a compiler
flag, e.g., `g++ -DSC_INCLUDE_FX` or use a define statement before
you include systemc.h, e.g.:

```
  #define SC_INCLUDE_FX
  #include "systemc.h"
```

Due to the large size of the fixed-point datatypes header files,
compilation can take considerably more time.

If you want to use the fixed-point data types only (i.e., not data-
types `sc_int`, `sc_uint`, `sc_bigint`, `sc_biguint`), compilation time can be
reduced by defining compile-time macro `SC_FX_EXCLUDE_OTHER` (in addition
to `SC_INCLUDE_FX`).
