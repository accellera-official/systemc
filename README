-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Organization

  The regression test suite is organized as follows. At the top level,
  we have a 'scripts' directory and a 'tests' directory.

  The 'scripts' directory contains the regression test
  script(s). Right now, this directory contains a single script,
  'verify.pl'. This script is written in perl. It works with perl5,
  which must be located in /usr/local/bin.

  The 'tests' directory contains the regression tests. The directory
  has a 'systemc' directory, which contain other directories. Actual
  tests are located in leaf directories.

  An actual test directory contains one or more source code files
  (ending in .cpp). If the directory contains one source code file,
  the name of the test is the filename (without extension) of that
  source code file. If the directory contains more than one source
  code file, there must be a file with extension .f that contains a
  list of source code files (one line per source code file, and the
  next higher directory must be added, e.g. 'arith_big/main.cpp'). In
  this case, the name of the test is the filename (without extension)
  of the .f file.
  The actual test directory may contain property files that tell the
  regression test script how to deal with the actual test, e.g. a
  'COMPILE' file tells the regression test script to only compile the
  source code file(s), and a 'DONTRUN' file tells the regression test
  script to skip the actual test directory. A 'DONTRUN' file in a non-
  test directory tells the regression test script to skip the tests in
  all its subdirectories.
  The actual test directory may contain a 'golden' directory, which
  contains one or more golden reference files (stripped). The
  filename of these files is the same as the test name (see above), and
  the extension starts with '.log'. Platform specific golden reference
  files append '.<platform>' to the file, e.g. 'test.log.sparcOS5'.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Running tests

  Regression tests can be run by calling the 'verify.pl' script. But,
  _do not_ put this script in your path, because the path to the
  script is used to determine where the regression tests are
  located.

  The 'verify.pl' script is located in the 'scripts' directory of the
  SystemC regression test suite. It requires the environment variable
  'SYSTEMC_HOME' to be set to your SystemC installation. Furthermore,
  you must use the 'CXX' environment variable to select the appropriate
  target architecture, just like with 'configure' when configuring
  SystemC. Valid settings for 'CXX' on the different platforms are:

  - Solaris 2.7 and Solaris 2.8:
    o c++, g++ -> gccsparcOS5 (default)
    o CC       -> sparcOS5

  - Linux (Redhat 6.2 and Redhat 7.2):
    o c++, g++ -> linux (default)

  - HP-UX 11.00:
    o aCC      -> hpux11

  - Cygwin 1.3.x (to run the regression tests for Visual C++ 6.0):
    o cl       -> msvc60

  Default, the 'verify.pl' script assumes that the tests are located
  in '../tests' (wrt the location of the script itself). This can be
  overrruled with environment variable 'SYSTEMC_TEST'.

  The 'verify.pl' script takes directories and names of tests as
  arguments. For example

    > .../systemc_tests-2.2.0/scripts/verify.pl systemc

  runs all the tests in the regression test suite. The directories
  should be relative to '$SYSTEMC_TEST/tests'. By specifying
  subdirectories, it is possible to run only a subset of the tests in
  the regression test suite, e.g.

    > .../systemc_tests-2.2.0/scripts/verify.pl systemc/datatypes/fx

  will run only the fixed-point regression tests. And if the name of
  the test/directory is unique, one can enter instead

    > .../systemc_tests-2.2.0/scripts/verify.pl fx

  which will run the same tests.

  There are several options that can be specified with the 'verify.pl'
  script. Most notibly, '-f <file>' which can be used to have a file
  containing the tests you want to run, and '-v' to run with verbose
  output.

  Note:
    Currently, not all options are fully implemented, and some may
    disappear in the future.

  The (temporary) results of the regression tests are stored in the
  current directory, i.e., the directory from where the 'verify.pl'
  script is called. Directories for tests that pass will be cleared
  (and if possible removed), unless the '-no-cleanup' option is
  specified. If a test fails all intermediate results will be
  kept. The directory structure of the (temporary) results is the same
  as the regression tests under '$SYSTEMC_TEST/tests'. Furthermore, in
  the current directory, a regression test log file called
  'verify.log' is created. This file contains the output of running
  each of the tests, and it contains a summary of which tests failed
  (with the phase in which they failed) and which tests passed.

  Beware:
    Always create a _temporary_ directory to run the tests in. You
    should _never_ run the tests in the directory in which the test
    sources are located (i.e. '$SYSTEMC_TEST/tests').


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Adding new tests

  When adding tests to the SystemC regression test suite, please stick
  to the following rules.

  - Group tests by feature.

  - Contributions of new tests should be put in a directory next to
    the 'systemc' directory. This directory could be called 'incoming'.
    The person(s) responsible for the SystemC regression test suite can
    then decide when and how to put these tests into the suite.

  - Every test goes into its own directory. This directory must be a
    leaf directory, that is, it can contain a 'golden' directory for
    the golden reference files, but it cannot contain directories
    holding other tests.

  - Source code files must end in '.cpp'.

  - If your test contains more than one source code file, you have to
    add a '.f' file, which lists the source code files (don't forget
    to prepend the current directory name -- just one level).

  - When running the test the first time, it will fail, because you
    don't have a golden reference file. To create this golden
    reference file, do the following.
      o Create the directory 'golden' in your test directory.
      o Make sure that the temporary test file called
        '<your_test>.log.stripped' is correct.
      o Copy the above file in the 'golden' directory in your test
        directory, and name it '<your_test>.log' or
        '<your_test>.log.<platform>' if you have different results on
        different platforms. If you do get different results on
        different platforms, you have to make sure that these
        differences are harmless and cannot be avoided (e.g. printing
        floating-point numbers with or without leading 0).
      o Now run your test again, and verify that it works now.
